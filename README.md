# Finding Maxima of Gaussian Sum-Product Networks

This repository contains resources of my master's thesis, "Finding Maxima of Gaussian Sum-Product Networks", and associated papers. The thesis was defended on 2023-07-21 at the Institute of Mathematics and Statistics of the University of São Paulo (IME-USP).

- `thesis/` contains LaTeX files of the thesis.
- `experiments/` contains files used to replicate the experiments.
- `eniac22/` contains resources of the paper "Tractable Mode-Finding using in Sum-Product Networks with Gaussian Leaves" (ENIAC, 2022).
- `tpm23/` contains resources of the paper "On Modal Clustering with Gaussian Sum-Product Networks" (UAI TPM Workshop, 2023).
